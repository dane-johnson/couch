## Roadmap
### Programmable Balls
I want my balls to be programmable, I need to create a few key classes
1. Balls, duh
2. Transforms, which represent position (of my balls)
3. Camera, to look at my balls
4. Shaders, to render my balls
### Programmable Balls Postmortem
Everything seems to work, but we need a system of what goes in the scene
I think a scene tree like the one in Godot would be cool

I keep switching scripting languages, can I make it so it's programmable in many languages, switchable via command line?

### Windows Compatible
I want to be able to build this for Windows
- I have no clue what that entails
- CMake?
- How to run SWIG on windows?
